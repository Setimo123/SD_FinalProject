## ?? Testing Recommendations

Before deploying to production, test the following:

### Test Case 1: Delete Student User
1. Create a test student user with:
   - Enrolled courses
   - Consultation requests
   - Action logs
2. Delete the student user
3. Verify all related records are deleted:
   - [ ] Student record deleted from `Students` table
   - [ ] Enrolled courses deleted from `EnrolledCourse` table
   - [ ] Consultation requests deleted from `ConsultationRequest` table
   - [ ] Action logs deleted from `ActionLog` table
   - [ ] User record deleted from `Users` table

### Test Case 2: Delete Faculty User
1. Create a test faculty user with:
   - Consultation requests assigned to them
   - Action logs
2. Delete the faculty user
3. Verify all related records are deleted:
   - [ ] Faculty record deleted from `Faculty` table
   - [ ] Consultation requests deleted from `ConsultationRequest` table
   - [ ] Action logs deleted from `ActionLog` table
   - [ ] User record deleted from `Users` table

### Test Case 3: Delete Admin User
1. Create a test admin user with action logs
2. Delete the admin user
3. Verify all related records are deleted:
   - [ ] Admin record deleted from `Admin` table
   - [ ] Action logs deleted from `ActionLog` table
   - [ ] User record deleted from `Users` table

### Test Case 4: User Cancels Delete
1. Click delete button
2. Click "No" on confirmation dialog
3. Verify:
   - [ ] User is NOT deleted
   - [ ] Related records are NOT deleted
   - [ ] No error messages displayed

### Test Case 5: Transaction Rollback
1. Simulate a database error during deletion
2. Verify:
   - [ ] Transaction is rolled back
   - [ ] No partial deletions occur
   - [ ] Error message is displayed
   - [ ] User and related records remain intact

### Test Case 6: UI Behavior
1. Delete from UserView:
   - [ ] Confirmation dialog appears
   - [ ] Success message appears
   - [ ] Form closes after deletion
2. Delete from UserCard context menu:
   - [ ] Confirmation dialog appears
   - [ ] Success message appears
   - [ ] Card is removed from UI

## ?? Security Considerations

- [x] Confirmation required before deletion
- [x] Default to "No" on confirmation dialog
- [x] Clear warning about permanent deletion
- [x] Transaction support prevents partial deletions
- [x] Error handling prevents application crashes

## ?? Database Impact

### Tables Affected by Delete Operation
1. `Users` - User account deleted
2. `Student` - Student profile deleted (if student)
3. `Faculty` - Faculty profile deleted (if faculty)
4. `Admin` - Admin profile deleted (if admin)
5. `EnrolledCourse` - Student courses deleted
6. `ConsultationRequest` - Consultations deleted
7. `ActionLog` - User activity logs deleted

### Foreign Key Constraints
The delete operation respects database foreign key constraints by:
- Deleting child records before parent records
- Using a transaction to ensure atomicity
- Rolling back on any failure

## ?? Feature Summary

### What Works
? Delete button in UserView
? Delete menu item in UserCard
? Confirmation dialogs
? Database deletion with cascading
? Transaction support
? Error handling
? UI updates after deletion

### What's Protected
? Accidental deletions (confirmation required)
? Partial deletions (transaction rollback)
? Data integrity (foreign key constraints)
? Application stability (comprehensive error handling)

## ?? Code Quality

- [x] Follows existing code patterns
- [x] Consistent with other delete implementations (Bulletin, Consultation)
- [x] Proper async/await usage
- [x] Comprehensive error messages
- [x] Console logging for debugging
- [x] XML documentation comments
- [x] Proper naming conventions

## ?? Deployment Ready
