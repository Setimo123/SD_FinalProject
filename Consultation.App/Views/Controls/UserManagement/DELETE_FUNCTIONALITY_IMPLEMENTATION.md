# Delete User Functionality Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the user deletion functionality in the User Management module. The implementation ensures safe deletion of user data from the database with proper confirmation dialogs and cascading deletions of related records.

## Changes Made

### 1. UserService.cs - New Delete Method
**File:** `Consultation.App\Services\UserService.cs`

Added a new method `DeleteUser(string umid)` that:
- Deletes the user and all related records from the database
- Uses database transactions to ensure atomic operations
- Handles cascading deletions based on UserType:
  - **Students:** Deletes enrolled courses and consultation requests
  - **Faculty:** Deletes or updates consultation requests assigned to them
  - **Admin:** Deletes admin records
- Deletes action logs related to the user
- Returns `true` on success, `false` on failure

```csharp
public async Task<bool> DeleteUser(string umid)
```

### 2. AAUserView.cs - Delete Button Implementation
**File:** `Consultation.App\Views\Controls\UserManagement\AAUserView.cs`

#### Changes:
1. **Constructor Update:** Wired up the `Delbutton` click event
   ```csharp
   Delbutton.Click += Delbutton_Click;
   Delbutton.Cursor = Cursors.Hand;
   ```

2. **New Method:** `Delbutton_Click` event handler
   - Shows confirmation dialog with detailed warning message
   - Lists what will be deleted (account + related records)
   - Defaults to "No" for safety
   - Calls `UserService.Instance.DeleteUser()` to perform deletion
   - Closes the UserView form on successful deletion
   - Shows appropriate success/error messages

### 3. AAUserCard.cs - Context Menu Delete Implementation
**File:** `Consultation.App\Views\Controls\UserManagement\AAUserCard.cs`

Added `deleteTSMI_Click` event handler that:
- Shows the same confirmation dialog as the Delbutton
- Calls `UserService.Instance.DeleteUser()` to perform deletion
- Removes the card from the UI on successful deletion
- Disposes the card properly

### 4. AAUserCard.Designer.cs - Wire Up Event
**File:** `Consultation.App\Views\Controls\UserManagement\AAUserCard.Designer.cs`

Added click event handler to the `deleteTSMI` context menu item:
```csharp
deleteTSMI.Click += deleteTSMI_Click;
```

## Features

### Safety Measures
1. **Confirmation Dialog:** Two-step confirmation with warning icon
2. **Default to No:** The "No" button is the default to prevent accidental deletions
3. **Detailed Warning:** Lists exactly what will be deleted
4. **Transaction Support:** Database changes are wrapped in a transaction
5. **Error Handling:** Comprehensive try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages

### Cascading Deletions
The delete operation removes:
- User account from `Users` table
- Student/Faculty/Admin record from respective tables
- Enrolled courses (for students)
- Consultation requests (for students and faculty)
- Action logs related to the user

### User Experience
1. **From UserView (View Details):**
   - Click the "Delete" button in the Quick Actions panel
   - Confirm deletion
   - UserView form closes automatically on success

2. **From UserCard (Context Menu):**
   - Click the "..." button on a user card
   - Select "Delete user" from the context menu
   - Confirm deletion
   - Card is removed from the UI on success

## Database Tables Affected

| Table | Action | Condition |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| `Users` | DELETE | Always |
| `Student` | DELETE | If UserType = Student |
| `Faculty` | DELETE | If UserType = Faculty |
| `Admin` | DELETE | If UserType = Admin |
| `EnrolledCourse` | DELETE | If user is a Student |
| `ConsultationRequest` | DELETE | If related to the user |
| `ActionLog` | DELETE | If related to the user |

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Delete button in UserView is visible and clickable
- [x] Delete menu item in UserCard context menu is visible and clickable
- [x] Confirmation dialog appears before deletion
- [x] Database transaction ensures atomic deletion
- [x] Related records are deleted (cascading delete)
- [x] UI updates after successful deletion
- [x] Error messages are shown on failure
- [x] No compilation errors

## Usage Example

### Deleting from UserView:
```csharp
// The button click is automatically wired up
// User clicks "Delete" button -> Confirmation -> Deletion -> Form closes
```

### Deleting from UserCard:
```csharp
// The context menu is automatically wired up
// User clicks "..." -> "Delete user" -> Confirmation -> Deletion -> Card removed
```

## Error Handling

All delete operations include:
1. Try-catch blocks for exception handling
2. Transaction rollback on failure
3. User-friendly error messages
4. Console logging for debugging

## Notes

1. **No button2:** The button2 component has been removed as requested
2. **Consistent Implementation:** Both delete entry points (Delbutton and deleteTSMI) use the same logic
3. **Service Pattern:** Deletion logic is centralized in UserService for maintainability
4. **Async/Await:** All database operations use async patterns for better performance

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Soft delete (mark as deleted instead of permanent deletion)
- Audit trail for deletions
- Restore deleted users functionality
- Bulk delete operations
- Admin-only deletion restrictions
